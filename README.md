# pwa
A repository for the exploration of offline HTML5 Application Cache and Progressive Web Apps.

# Set up for development and testing
Clone the repository to your desktop, open a command prompt, travel to the directory that contains index.html and type:

python -m http.server 1337

then open a browser and go to the address 127.0.0.1:1337

Use this when testing and developing so you don't need to add changes to the github repo master branch all the time.


# Downloading the Web App
First go to the home page: https://c-j-1.github.io/HTML5WebApp/

To download the Web App, there are different methods based on different browsers or devices. The ability to download the app will not be available if it has already been been downloaded. Uninstall the app to regain the ability to download it.

If you are using Firefox, Brave, or Chrome on a Windows computer there will be a small (+) sign on the right hand side of the URL bar when you are on the home page. By clicking on this you will be given an option to download the Web App to your desktop, or cancel.

If you're using an Android device, an "Add to home screen" dialog box will pop up on the home page and you can choose to download it or cancel.

If you're using an iOS device (Safari Browser), press the share button at the top of the browser bar while on the home page, then click on "add to home screen". This method is limited, as downloading the app to the homescreen will only allow you to open it in a browser, not as it's own seperate web app.

The ability to download the app on a linux device running Ubuntu using Firefox Quantum v68.0.1 has been tested and is currently unavailable.


# Try it Offline

Download the web app using one of the above methods, disconnect your device from the internet, and open the web app on your desktop or home screen.
